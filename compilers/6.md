must refine methods, which return itself as type, for each of its subclass, with specialized return type
i.e., reversed SELF_TYPE type. The method return type should be changed SELF_TYPE whenever applicable

SELF_TYPE depends on the context, i.e., a subtype of the class where it appears in the class body

note T <= SELF_TYPE(C) is always false, because SELF_TYPE(C) can force any subtype, and thus will diverge. Techinically the single leaf case is too, but too fragile, and thus normally not used in practice. 

-----
SELF_TYPE not allowed to appear ANYWHERE a type is used 

let x: T in E can be self type
new T can be self type => create an object of same type as self

static dispact can not be self type
method definition: return type can be self type, but NOT argument. Otherwise, you will have arg Type <= SELF_TYPE, which contradicts the previous seciton discussion. Concretely, we can use the field exlusive to SELF_TYPE but not the arg Type, which type checks but won't work in run time

SELF_TYPE dispatch rule is special-modified

NO_TYPE for use with ill-typed expression, NO_TYPE <= C for all classes. A simpler, but uglier way is to assign Object type

---------

lifetime is run-time concept, scope is static- portion of text in which the variables are visible

activation record/frame: info needed to manage one procedure activiation

e.g. result | argument | control link (pointer to caller activation) | return address

note it is not actually, result is stored in AR. need to relook up

AR layout and code gen have to be designed together, because they depend on each other

can't store global in activation records => assigned fixed addressed once, essentially at compile time

code | static/global | stack -> high address | <- heap
similarly, value that outlives the procedure that creates it  => use heap (e.g., malloc/free)
