Regular language: weakest formal language

state machine can handle count mod k, but a lot of languages, k can be arbitrarily high

input: sequence of tokens
output: parse tree of the program

CFG:
1. terminals
2. non-terminals
3. start symbol
4. set of productions

e.g. parantheis balance
1. S -> (S)
2. S -> empty

N = {S}
T = {(, )}

L(G) = {a... | for all ai in T and s -> *  a...}

Terminals ought to be the tokens of the language

COOL CFG example
```
EXPR -> if EXPR then EXPR else EXPR fi
 | while EXPR loop EXPR pool
 | id
```

Arithmetic
E -> E + E | E * E | (E) | id

inorder-traversal is the original input

left/right most derivation should yield the same parse tree!
at each step replace the left most non-terminal

A grammer is ambigous if it has more than one parse tree for the some string

-------
Error handling:
1. panic mode - most popular. Discarding tokens until one with clear role is found, continue from there, typically end of statement
bison: use the speical terminal error to describe how much input to skip
2. error productions: specify known common errors in grammer


AST: like parse tree but with soem details ignored, so that more compact and easier to use
Prase tree: too much info => parenthesisi, sometimes only 1 succesor node

top-down parsing: 
1. from the top
2. from left to right
3. terminals appear in the order

RDA:
bool term(TOKEN tok) {
	return *next++ == tok;
}


bool S_n_production () {

}

bool S() {

}

E -> T + E
bool E_2() {
	return T() && term(PLUS) && E();
}

//backtracking
bool E() {
TOKEN save = next;
return (next = save, E1()) || (next = save, E2())

}

Functions for non-terminal T
bool T1()
bool T2()
bool T3()

bool T() {
//back track similar to the one above here
}

recursive descent algorithm(RDA) limitation: 
consider int * int => it will terminate early, input pointer not eof => reject! If a prod for non-terminal succeeds, can not backtrack to try a different production for x later
but sufficient for grammars where for any non-terminal at most one production can succeed => refactoring by left factoring

left recursion:
S -> Sa => infinite loop, starts with a non-terminal s.t. the same symbol still in the leftmost position

similarly S -> Sa | b, first token appears last, i.e., right to left instead of left to right required by RDA, so need to replace left recursion with right recursion!

Dragon book has a general algo to fix left recursion
