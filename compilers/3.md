Regular language: weakest formal language

state machine can handle count mod k, but a lot of languages, k can be arbitrarily high

input: sequence of tokens
output: parse tree of the program

CFG:
1. terminals
2. non-terminals
3. start symbol
4. set of productions

e.g. parantheis balance
1. S -> (S)
2. S -> empty

N = {S}
T = {(, )}

L(G) = {a... | for all ai in T and s -> *  a...}

Terminals ought to be the tokens of the language

COOL CFG example
```
EXPR -> if EXPR then EXPR else EXPR fi
 | while EXPR loop EXPR pool
 | id
```

Arithmetic
E -> E + E | E * E | (E) | id

inorder-traversal is the original input

left/right most derivation should yield the same parse tree!
at each step replace the left most non-terminal

A grammer is ambigous if it has more than one parse tree for the some string

-------
Error handling:
1. panic mode - most popular. Discarding tokens until one with clear role is found, continue from there, typically end of statement
bison: use the speical terminal error to describe how much input to skip
2. error productions: specify known common errors in grammer


AST: like parse tree but with soem details ignored, so that more compact and easier to use
Prase tree: too much info => parenthesisi, sometimes only 1 succesor node

top-down parsing: 
1. from the top
2. from left to right
3. terminals appear in the order

recursive descent algorithm(RDA) limitation:
