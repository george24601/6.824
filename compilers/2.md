Token (from lexeme) classes: Identifier, integer, keyword, whitespace

lookahead  maybe required to decide, but we want to bound it, e.g. "==" token, "else" token at the first char

In cpp, >> stream operator or nested template? that is why we have to put a whitespace to help lexer

ep = language with empty string, instead of empty language

Union: A + B 
AB: concatitation
iteration: A^star, A^0 = ep

sum sign: alphabet

meaning funciton L: exp -> set of strings (syntax to semantics)

many more expressions than meanings

option: A? 
A+: at least one 

lexical spec steps
1. write regex for each lexme
2. just all the union all regex in the step above

how much input to look at => always take the longest one!

pick the higher priority in token class
error class bottom of the list

translate lex spec -> regex -> NFA -> DFA ->Table driven

NFA to DFA
--------
calcualte ep closure
a(X) = {y | x in X and a(x) = y} 

DFA: subset of NFA
start: ep-closure of NFA start state

final state: {x|x in X intersect final state of NFA is not empyt}

DFA can be implemented by a 2D table T

pointer-compact techinique to reduce duplicated rows
may use NFA when DFA states are just too huge
