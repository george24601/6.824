predicative parsing: top down, but parser can predict which produciton to use
by looking at the next few tokens, NO backtracking
accept LL(k) grammers: left to right read, left most derivation, k tokens of look ahead, mostly 1

hard to prdiect with LL(1) when: 
1. two prductions with same terminal
2. two prductions with the same non-terminal
=> need to left factoring => factor out common prefix, add a suffix productions/non-terminal

if alpha can derive a t in the first position,t in First(alpha)
if alpha can go epsilon, and t can follow immediately after A in the grammar then t in Follow(A) => t appears in a derivation AFTER A, NOT derived!

First(X) = {x | X -> t alpha} union {ep | X -> ep}

X -> AB, if B ->star ep, then first(B) in follow(A), follow(X) in follow(B)
if B -> ep, then follow(X) in follow(A) too!
note ep not in Follow but in First

EOF in Follow(start symbol:$)

A -> alpha X beta: 
1.First(beta) - {ep} in Follow(X)
2. Follow(A) in Follow(X)

To derive: 
1. find non-term with term X immediately after
2. mark down follow(LHS) in Follow(X), note any A<=B and B<= A
3. Find the First(non-term after X)
4.  if non-term after X -> ep, then add Follow(LHS) too!
5. need to calculate Follow(term) too, unlike First(term)!

Construct an LL(1) parsing table T for CFG G
--------
For each A -> alpha in G
	for each terminial t in First(alpha)
		T[A, t] = alpha
	if ep in First(alpha), for each t in Follow(A)
		T[A,t] = alpha
	if ep in First(alpha), and $ in Follow(A)
		T[A, $] = alpha

T[X, $] = ep, if $ in Follow(X)

Blank entry means parsing error

Example: build a LL(1) parsing table for S-> Sa | b  => will have entries with multiple moves!

However, most PL CFG are not LL(1)


Bottom-up parsing
-----------
Preferred method in parser-generator, more general than determinstic top-down. Does not need left-factored grammars, but can not handle ambigious grammars

The production reads backwards is a right-most derivation

consider alpha beta omega , if we go X -> beta, the omega is a string of terminals 

right substring: terminals not yet parsed
left substring: seen, both terminal and non-terminal symbols

Shift: move | one place to the right
Reduce: apply an inversion production at the right end of the left string

-------------

Handle: a reduction that allows further reduction into the start symbol

No efficient algo to recognize handles => good heuritics to identify handles correctly
