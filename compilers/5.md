Some programming constructs are not context free - hence semantics analysis can not be skipped

static scope: depends on only the program text, not run time behaviour

Inside COOL,
class can not be nested, but can be used before declared
attribute names are global within the class

------
Much of semantics analysis can be described as a recursive descentnt into AST

e.g., let x : int <- 0 in e, symbol table + x will be passed into the parse tree of e

symbol table: can be implemented as a simple stack for let (for perfected nested)
add_symbol(x)
find_symbol(x)
remove_symbol(): just pop the stack

=> what if we have multi args enter scope at the same tiem ,e.g., func signature? 

enter_scope()
add_symbol(x)
find_symbol(x)
check scope(x)
exit_scope()

class name is special:  because can be used before decalred => use two passes one to detect classes, and then do the checking

------------
classes is not same as types, just a modern instantitation of types

special: SELF_TYPE
