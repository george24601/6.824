a scanner, using a lexical analyzer generator

. Flex compiles your rule file (e.g.,
“lexer.l”) to C (or, if you are using JLex, Java) source code implementing a finite automaton recognizing
the regular expressions that you specify in your rule file

A rule in Flex specifies an
action to perform if the input matches the regular expression or definition at the beginning of the rule

t if the current input (i.e., the result of the function call to
yylex()) matches multiple rules, Flex picks the rule that matches the largest number of characters.

We strongly encourage you to read the documentation on Lex written by Lesk
and Schmidt linked from the Project Resources section on the class wiki before writing your own lexical
analyzer.

you are expected to write Flex rules that match on the appropriate regular expressions
defining valid tokens in Cool as described in Section 10 and Figure 1 of the Cool manual and perform the
appropriate actions, such as returning a token of the correct type, recording the value of a lexeme where
appropriate, or reporting an error when an error is encountered.

 then study the different tokens defined
in cool-parse.h. Your implementation needs to define Flex/Jlex rules that match the regular expressions
defining each token defined in cool-parse.h and perform the appropriate action for each matched token.

The first way is to generate sample inputs
and run them using lexer, which prints out the line number and the lexeme of every token recognized
by your scanner. 

 The other way, when you think your scanner is working, is to try running mycoolc to
invoke your lexer together with all other compiler phases (which we provide). This will be a complete
Cool compiler that you can try on any test programs.
