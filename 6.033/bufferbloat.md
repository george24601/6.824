Do you believe that bufferbloat occurs frequently on the Internet?


Which of the following statements about the Bufferbloat problem are true?
------
Bufferbloat prevents TCP from increasing its window size, leading to low TCP throughput.
Bufferbloat dramatically increases the delay, causing interactive applications to timeout or be unresponsive.
Bufferbloat significantly increases the time it takes to finish transferring large files (e.g.,
a 1 GB upload).
Bufferbloat can happen both at the edge of the network and deep inside the network.
