Vista has 50 million LoC, Facebook at 70 million

One way to enforce modularity is with a client/server
 model, where the two modules reside on different
 machines and communicate with RPCs; network/
 server failures are still an issue


READING TIPS
------------
Start with a quick pass, just reading the section headings and the figure captions, to get an idea of the layout of the paper and what kinds of things the authors seem to be trying to communicate.
Next, skim it quickly, looking primarily at the first and last paragraph of each section.

As you read the paper, try to distinguish solid technical facts from higher-level statements that the authors are trying to make about process, procedures and policy. You might find it useful to note the places where you agree or disagree with the authors' analysis.

Finally, don't be dismayed by unfamiliar technical jargon; make a guess about what it means and move on. The authors may explain it two paragraphs later, or two pages later, or perhaps never get around to it. There is a good chance that you will discover that it didn't actually matter. But if it does, you have something to ask about in recitation.

Critique
--------
Before beginning to write, think about how you might organize your critique. You might assess each module in turn, or each design goal. You might order design goals by importance (e. g. most to least important) or by strength (strongest to weakestâ€”or the reverse!) Use your introduction to forecast and your conclusion to recap.


Introduction presents the system and prepares readers for the paper
Briefly summarizes how the system works.
Identifies the priorities or design principles.
Enables reader to answer what, how, why

Conclusion summarizes the system and its key advantages and disadvantages
May respond to or re-connect to the introduction
