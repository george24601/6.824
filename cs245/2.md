Some numbers
----------
1. mutex lock/unlock is around same range of RAM access ~ 100ms

2. Read 1MB sequentially from RAM ~ 0.25MB

3. Round trip within the same DC 0.5ms

4. Read 1MB sequentially from network 10ms, 25 times slower than memory

5. Read 1MB sequentially from disk 30ms,i.e., 100 times slower than memory, note this number does not include disk seek overhead!

6. Roundtrip between CA to netherland 150ms, 300 times sloer than the same DC case


Storages
----------
1. Disk seek is additional 10ms, on SSD this goes down to around 0.10ms => 100 times faster! Sequenct

2. cost for writing is similar to reading w/o verfication, otherwise add a (full) rotation + blocksize/tranfer rate

3. SSD: storage is block oriented, lots of errors, but masked by on-device logic, use a log structed 

4. Seq write improves througput because of less book keeping, but latency remains same compared to random writes

5. Latency and throughput for sequential reads is roughly same as random read

6. Random access time: SSD 0.1s, HD: 3-10ms

7. Data transfer rate: 100MB to 600 MS on SSD, < 140MB on HD

8. Reliability: SSD hard to fail multiple power failures, averge falure rate is 6 years

9. Cost: lower cost is at 1TB SSD, avg 0.35 per GB, 10 times that of traditional HD


Double buffering
---------
2 buffers instead of one, so that we always read the next block into the unread buffer, this saves IO time/block latency, assuming processing buffer time >= IO tiem


Five Minute Rule
----------
1. Should a page be on memory or on disk?

2. cost of disk (CD) = $Disk unit price / X seconds * Ios the unit can perform

3. cost of memory (CM) = $M (cost of 1 MB ram) / P (number of pages in 1MB)
