Part A: Key/value service without log compaction

1. implement as a replicated state machine. Use a channel to notify that state has been processed, so that the blocking request can reply. 

Remember give go channel some capacity, otherwise, it will block until the message has been consumed 

2. same log index may appear multiple times

3. use a simple seq number to ensure no duplicate append command
